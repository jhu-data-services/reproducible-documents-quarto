# Creating Reproducible Documents with Quarto
Quarto is a free, open source, and highly flexible technical publishing system that can be used to create reproducible, production quality articles, presentations, dashboards, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more. In this training, attendees will receive an in-depth introduction to how to use Quarto to combine text and code into reproducible documents. Particular focus will be on the anatomy of a Quarto document, rather than on using Quarto to produce any particular document type or with any particular programming language. Prior knowledge of markdown or a programming language may be helpful, but is not required.
